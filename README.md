Welcome to our wedding site! From here we have created a place to put announcements and new information for our friends and family! We know a lof of people are coming from out of town so hopefully this will be a place to help you to plan and get ahold of us!

## Please Provide Your Contact Information!

We are trying to streamline the invitation process as much as possible, and so our strategy is to send out hard copies of the Save-the-Date announcement and electronic invitations. We don't have everyone's info, so if you could please visit this survey and fill out your info, that would help us out a lot!

## Accommodations

We are working with a Mt.Vernon Grand Hotel to provide some guaranteed rooms for our out of town guests, which is most of the guests! Currently we are reserving 39 rooms for Saturday (the maximum), and 15 for Friday, but we can reserve more as there becomes a need

### Mt. Vernon Grand Hotel

Lovely Hotel in a lovely town nearby to the Beverly Mansion.

-  We haven't spoken to anyone at the Comfort Inn, but it is located close to the other hotel. We may reach out to them if rooms at the Grand start to sell out

### Nearby areas:
If you can, try and stay in Mount Vernon at the Grand Hotel so that we can honor our agreement with management for the number of reserved rooms. In the event that Rooms sell out at the Grand and the Comfort Inn, you can search nearby areas for rooms. Polaris is the furthest away, but should definitely have rooms available nearby, since it is fully in the northern part of Columbus. Lots of shopping nearby, but it is still out of the way. Delaware and Mansfield are both nice towns approximately the same distance from the the Beverly Mansion.
